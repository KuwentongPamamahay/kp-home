## Cultural Spaces and Community

Placeholder text.

### "People can make cultural spaces anywhere."

[7:03-10:58]

**Josh Rasalan**: I forgot who told this to me, but I think someone said that cultural spaces don't have to be physical, but it really is with the people. So, people can make cultural spaces anywhere: in the park, in this library room, in the amenities room in an apartment. Anywhere, right? And so, it could have been at a tito's house, it could have been at a recreation center, like any space can be a cultural space, it's the people that makes it cultural spaces. And so, because that's, there is no really...Cultural Center. But there are, there's definitely like Filipino-built spaces, like only, like Filipino stores or like churches or I know that there's like a Filipino diamond society for like seniors who really built a space for them. Yeah, that's...it’s not really about like the physical spaces, but the people who create those spaces.

**Claire Baguio**: Yeah, and speaking of those, those people, like you had a lot of mentors that helped you navigate, or like, create those spaces. That it sounds were...were there any? Yeah, sorry, I'm just going to rephrase that, because...Regarding those spaces, you see spaces for the community as other people. And it's, from what I'm, from my perspective, it sounds like you also feel that way about like your mentors as well. Do you really feel like they ushered you into those spaces?

**JR**: I think so. Yeah. They definitely introduced me to those spaces a whole lot. And because of the, like, snowball effect, of like me meeting other people, like it's now only so natural to like, find these spaces, myself. Yeah, not only like through Instagram or like word of mouth. It's easier to find spaces now. Whereas like, maybe for someone who's not as involved in community, right? They're not seeing that these events exist, right? So like, you would go to these events and you would see the same people over and over again, right? Because like we're in the know, we're in the circle, right? Whereas, if you are still learning more about Filipino community...it’s harder to find these events.

**CB**: You're, you're saying that it's like harder to find these events and spaces? If you're not, you know, quote unquote, “in the know.”

**JR**: Yeah.

**CB**: Do you feel like there is...like, is there...do you feel like there's a way to maybe bridge that gap?

**JR**: I guess that's one of my personal hopes for Mabuhay House and the Cultural Center is that it's really going to be a hub for Filipino organizations, right? It’s kind of like that one stop hub for like oh, whether you are first, 1.5, second generation, even third generation Filipino of like, wanting to find community, like Mabuhay House will be that idea of, “oh, I can go to this space to, to find services, to find events, to find socials that are relevant to me.”

### "And yeah, there's something about like seeing myself reflected back in like in the staff and like the people and in the faculty, where it was like, ah, yes, music and someone that seems familiar, I can latch onto that immediately."

**Kathleen Zaragosa**: “I was a music kid for like, all of school. And I think like, I mean, for context, as well, like I grew up singing at a very early age. And then I think my parents had pinpointed that and was like, we're gonna put you into singing lessons now. And I started singing lessons. At the age of five, I was singing a lot at church, like learned hymns at a very early age. And I actually attribute like me learning Philippine languages to me learning how to sing songs first before I learned how to speak them. So like, that was all like, through my church upbringing. And through like, just being around the community, like that was very, it was nurtured at a very early age. And I grew up kind of like performing at church events and things like that, and like being on stage through my childhood. So like when I went to high school, actually, one of the only Filipino teachers was my choir teacher. I believe she's Filipino Malaysian. And yeah, there's something about like seeing myself reflected back in like in the staff and like the people and in the faculty, where it was like, Ah, yes, music and someone that seems familiar, I can latch onto that immediately. And then seeing other friends who had a very similar like music, upbringing experience, also kind of like, like, go full on into all the different music involvements, like we had a liturgy band, we have multiple choirs and like we went fully into that there was a musical that I joined in grade eight, and like I was auditioning for it even like in grade seven towards the  end of the school year. I'm so I was really just trying to set myself up for being like, Yeah, I'm going to be involved in these ways. And these are the ways that I'm going to be able to interact and like find more of a comfort level for myself, like set a baseline for myself. So that I don't feel so out of my depths, trying to adjust to a new environment. So I think yeah, like really, I was, I really emphasized, like, trying to do as many music things as I could, in an effort to like, stay connected with other people.”

## Filipino Identity in Canada

Placeholder text.

### "Oh, I rarely say that I'm Filipino Canadian."

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KA6Bd7ZaYwo?si=SOjcTVhXh6XRcgGq&amp;start=1608" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

**Claire Baguio**: And I have a bit of a maybe...a little bit off topic. But I mean, I'm wondering do you consider yourself to be Filipino Canadian, because you've only moved here in 2016. So, I'm wondering if that's an, I guess, like an identifier you use or you just identify as Filipino.

**Jasper Mallonga**: Oh, I rarely say that I'm Filipino Canadian. And the only...the only reason I say that sometimes, if I do, it's more of just identifying myself as someone who lives here. And not really, you know, I don't, I don't know what it means to be Canadian. But I do know how much Filipino I am. And yeah, I've never really been in a place where I have to define what it means. But you know, it's, I only use Filipino Canadian for things like bios, for LinkedIn or something or whatever. But other than that, I...yeah, I don't know what it means to be Canadian. Other than, you know, having that citizenship, or passport or whatnot, I'm not entirely sure.

### "We were always striving for like that Filipino-ness."

[3:20-4:22]

**Sammie Jo Rumbaua**: “I guess the intro for myself being in Vancouver since 1990, is just I've always been involved in the Filipino community in regards to participating in Philippine Independence Day, with a dance with a hip hop dance group. That's kind of how I really got immersed with the Filipino community and with the entertainment, having friends that are dancers and hip hoppers, and DJs and all that stuff. So I actually started off doing all ages events here. But yeah, it was really like, kind of like, you know, a little bit of hip hop saved my life or my best friend's sister was a was a choreographer, and they actually held dance classes at Collingwood Neighbourhood Houses, Collingwood Neighborhood House. And so we just danced, and we wanted to perform for people. And so I was like, 16, and be like, let's book a hall and let's do competitions and all that stuff. So that was really like the start of even my event productions and stuff.”

[6:55-8:15]

**SJR**: But even coming to Vancouver, there was not that many Filipino, like coming to BC, there wasn't that many Filipinos in the schools at that time anyways. And so I think, you know, that whole transition of being like, okay, we're back in Canada, which is, which is cool, but we were always striving for like that Filipino-ness, like wanting, you know, we're lucky that my parents, you know, cook Filipino food, but we're always like, looking for those. You know, things like the markets, or just the stores and everything so, and then having, you know, that time of living in Vancouver, Surrey, Richmond, you know, you kind of saw more of the Filipinos in Richmond, because that's where most of the Chinese Filipino restaurants were, or stores or even. But, you know, like I said, Thank goodness for those independent days that every, you know, Filipino Independence Day Celebration, that's kind of where we gather and I would tell all my friends, like this sort of good and I only and in schools, I wasn't, there was not that many Filipinos in schools, but because of dance, a lot of Filipinos ended up joining us in dance. And I ended up like really being friends with a lot of private school kids. And that were Filipino. Because in the public school, we weren't they weren't there. Like it was mostly non Filipinos at that time. My early, early age.”

[8:38-10:59]

**Jocelle Refol**: How did you end up getting involved in the community at such a young age when there wasn't as many Filipinos that you could see present in Vancouver at that time?

**SJR**:Yeah. I mean, I could remember. Well, even when grade six, like in Surrey, so I was, you know, I just remember my best friend, Rouella like she's my best friend for since today. She literally came out, she's like, are you Filipino? Because like, there's literally only three Filipinos, me, Rouella, and Reggie in our grade, Surrey elementary school Panorama Park. And so when I was like, yeah, I'm Filipino and she's like, yeah, me too. And she happened to live two doors down for me. And so with that, it was her family was already immersed in the Filipino community where her mom was like the president  GIMILAMI, Filipino Catholic Association who held Santacruzan. And so I would go with her to her events. And she was like, in the Santa Cruzan like, she was like the her mom's association was doing the whole Santa Cruzan thing and so being a princess and all that stuff, so I like tag along. But really, when we started our hip hop dance group, you know, our choreographer was already performing in those Independence Day at Plaza of Nations nations. And so that was kind of like the point of like, let's get all our friends to come watch us and perform. And so, you know, I think there was also our friends Lani &amp; Boom Duyupay, they started a TV show called Mango Vibe, like, a long time ago. And it was literally like featuring, like Filipinos that were doing things because we had a lot of friends that were like dancers and DJs. And we just wanted to feature them and let the world know about, like how talented they are. And so Boom used to be in a singing group called Kulay in Vancouver, and he went back and forth to the Philippines to and he's like film director and stuff. And so he really kind of showed how to, like display our arts and culture and talent on film and video. And so and there was also a calendar that he oops, there was also a calendar that, that he produced to do a fundraiser and my older cousin, Mary Anne and her son, Adryan was in it. And so it literally was like a calendar. I don't even know what it was fundraising for, or whatever. But it just featured all the Filipino cool teenagers because I was like, I was like, 13 at the time. And they were like, all, like 17, 18.”

### “Well, I'm not the stereotype, and so maybe my identity isn't as strong because I don't follow those stereotypes.”

[0:00-3:20]

**Claire Baguio**: Okay, so what is your relationship to being Filipino or Filipino Canadian? 

**Alex Montinola**: It's very minimal, truthfully. And I, like I think, like, I've thought about it over the years in terms of where this, this came from, like, this lack of connection. And sometimes, like, I would go to Filipino events, and sometimes I'd go do like stereotypically Filipino things, and it just wouldn't interest me so much. And then I would feel bad about that, because I'm like, this is my heritage, this is something that I should be, like, enjoying being part of, and like, having it be part of my identity. But it's just not something that interests me as much as, like, it doesn't interest me in the same way that I'm like, I like this kind of book genre versus this one. And sometimes I see like, Filipino pride or like, like these other Filipinos doing so well and in their fields, and I feel a sense of pride in that way. 

But I wouldn’t put up a Filipino flag on my car, or. It’s not part of—like, it is it is part of, important part of my identity because of the cultural aspect In terms of like, yeah, like, I grew up Roman Catholic, my parents would speak to me in Tagalog, they... like, I eat Filipino food. And that's, that's like the reason why I could never go full vegan, because it's like, I can’t—my partner's mostly vegan, like strong - 12 - vegetarian, weak vegan, as she says. But I can’t fully commit to that type of lifestyle. Because Filipino food is— like, I love food and Filipino food, even if I don't have it all the time. It's still something I want to take part of. So I guess it's, it's not—like, being Filipino is not as part of my identity in the same way as being like a psychiatric nurse is part of my identity. It’s not as big of a part. But it's kind of just interwoven to who I am. And like, my preferences and the things that—the experiences I want to, want or don't want to take part in. 

I really want to go back to the Philippines and be part of that culture again. I remember my family once went on a cruise over the summer, and also the waitstaff are Filipino. And so it was nice, being able to use Tagalog and speak in that way. And so I guess it's my relationship to being Filipino and the identity aspect isn't as minimal as, as I previously thought, just, even just saying now. I’m like—  

**CB**: Yeah, even just talking about it. 

**AM**: —well, actually, there's a lot of things. But I guess it's not, like—when I think minimum—like, when I think of someone that has a strong identity, it's like, Filipino flags, Like, maybe more like stereotypes and stuff like that. And I'm like, well, I'm not the stereotype, and so maybe my identity isn't as strong because I don't follow those stereotypes. But then I guess it's like, the small things that matter to me are things that are part of like, maybe not my current identity, but it's definitely part of my history.

## Defining Home

Placeholder text.

### "My feelings of homesickness are not a longing for my hometown, but for a particular moment in time, because place does change."

[1:41:20-1:45:15]

**Claire Baguio**: Okay, so we're almost at the end. And I just wanted to ask about home and homemaking. So, how do you define home? And are there any specific places here in like, Vancouver or Canada that make you feel at home? 
 
**Darla Tomeldan**: What do you mean by homemaking? 
 
**CB**: Yeah, so homemaking is like the idea of like...not every place you move to and live in feels like home. So how do you make a home? And I guess it's a bit open ended in the sense that you can define what that is for you. And what that what that looks like for you, as well.  
 
**DT**: Cause part of your question was “what emotions do you associate with home?” Maybe we could start with that.  

**CB**: Yeah, let's do that. What are the questions? 
 
**DT**: Yeah, I came up with a sense of belonging, comfort and familiarity. Home to me used to be my, my hometown, there are times where I would feel homesick. But now, I’m beginning to understand that my feelings of homesickness are not a longing for my hometown, but for a particular moment in time, because place does change. Longing for a particular period of time. But now…I hope this doesn't sound cliche, but considering all the challenges and successes we've shared, Cecilia has become my home, my sanctuary, where I feel safe. So, it doesn't matter whether we're in Canada, whether we’re in Philippines, or wherever we decide to retire. That would be Cecilia.  
 
**Cecilia Tumolva**: Bigla naman akong na-touch doon. How am I gonna top this? 
 
**CB**: How are you gonna...No, it's not a cliche, I'm literally like, this is so cute.  
 
**CT**: Is it my turn? 
 
**DT**: It’s your turn.  
 
**CT**: Okay... 
 
**DT**: You could say ditto.  
 
**CT**: So how would you define home for me. Home is a place, space where you're most comfortable to be who you are. And that also means being with people who accept you for who you are. So that adds really to the idea of home and the feeling of home. And also, being with people who speak my language. And my mother is Illocano, and my father is Ibanag. And so, it's not just Tagalog. So, every time I hear people speaking, although I cannot speak fluently Illocano or Ibanag, I can understand it. It really adds to the fact that “oh my goodness, I am home.” Even though I am not in the Philippines, I am hearing the same languages that I grew up with gives me a real sense of home. And the karaoke. 

### "Water is the connection to home."

[00:03-4:25]

**Claire Baguio**:
How do you define home?

**Josh Rasalan**: I think it’s really that connection with people, to people, to spaces.
I guess like I’m reflecting on, when I traveled to Europe, right? Last year, I was able to go to a couple of countries in Europe, which was like Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, Czech Republic, to all of these countries, like obviously, like very European, but I was still trying to find Filipinos, right? “Oh, there's a Filipino restaurant here. Let's go eat there!” I was solo traveling, but I was like, “hey, let's go eat here” with my friend. “I want to introduce you to Filipino food.” Or like seeing a Filipino store, down the street, unexpectedly, getting so excited, going in there. Or even like, being in Sweden in the mall, I like hearing a couple of Filipinos talk in Tagalog. And then being like so excited, right?
And it was like, very fleeting moments of just like just seeing other Filipinos. That's where I felt a sense of home in a very non-home place. In a very foreign place. Where I was like, I'm so disconnected. Like, I have no relationship like...like, Europe is such an alien place for me that it felt very uncomfortable. But being able to just see a Filipino restaurant, a Filipino store, or hearing Filipinos talk in Filipino. That gave me a sense of grounding and like a return back to home.
And I remember going to...in Sweden, I went to like this waterfront, to this beach with my friend. And I was staring out into the water. And I was like, felt overwhelmed by emotions. I'm feeling like “wow, like who would have thought that I would be here in Europe?” Far away from home, be it from the Philippines, be it from here in Vancouver or BC. But what's connecting me to home is through the water.
And so, like thinking about how like Philippines, like 7000 plus islands are connected by waters. And understanding how water is the connection to home. Just being able to see the water, to touch the water I instantly felt connected to home. 
And so, back in, maybe that was like May, I also went to Korea, right? Like in Asia, closer to the Philippines right? And I remember going to Yeosu, which is like one of the southernest most, southern most point of Korea. We went to the water, to the vast blue sea. And I instantly felt the connection of liike “how I’m like this close to the Philippines.” The connection to the water knowing that just down this water is the Philippines. But there's also that sense of homesickness. “Oh I’m here in Asia and I'm so close to the Philippines, but I’m not able to go back.”
Yeah…and so, whether I’m here at home, BC or home in the Philippines, I've always tried to find home, taking meaning of it through water, through other Filipino spaces.

### "Once I feel like, like it's permanent permanent then yeah, that would that would like really help with like, feeling more at home."

[1:43-2:35, 3:55-4:21]

**Jocelle Refol**: Do you have like any like specific areas in Joyce like what are like places that really remind you of like, the Philippines or home? 

**Niña Labuguen**: Wait, Joyce and Fraser St. Yeah. It's basically the church and then outside of it. Like like at Joyce station, the St. Mary's Church. And then outside of it is like the the Filipino kulinaryas areas like the canteens. Because it seems like it's like [Turo Turo?]. So it's like  I'm like (head nod), and then at Fraser, it's cuz so a lot of like, like, Philippine like, I would just walk there. Like, I think Fraser and 49th. And then it's like, there's some stores there that would sell like, halo halo or like other stuff. But yeah, it was it's basically that.”

**JR**: Do you frequent those areas often or only on occasion? 

**NL**: I don't anymore. I used to every time I used to go to church, but I kind of stopped because of school. And it's getting tough out there. But um, yeah, but I've stopped, I only go there when I'm like craving for Filipino food. But it kind of changed now for me, because I'm missing. I'm missing like Mexican culture severely.” 

[2:57 – 4:21, 6:21 – 7:10]

**NL**: “Yeah cuz like, I don't really have like, I've been moving. And it's not really like a permanent house. Like, probably like, something closely related to that would be like my boyfriend's house. But at the same time, that doesn't feel like as much of a home for me. It's just basically house. But at the same time, that doesn't feel like as much of a home for me. It's just basically like, where I currently live. That's, that's what I feel like at home.

**JR**: Are there like to like, you don't really consider like your current place of residence as home. But yeah, do you think like, specifically Vancouver doesn't feel homey to you?

**NL**: No, no, it's like, it feels familiar. Right? But nothing like, home. Like I know, I know, every time I go to the airport, and I just like land here like after going to Philippines and land here. It just feels like Well, I'm back home. It's like, it's it's that.

**JR**: That's interesting, because earlier, like you mentioned about like, people that you're with that helps that home feeling but in Vancouver, would you say that like even with the people like it still doesn't feel quite homey?

**NL**: Cuz because it's like, yeah, sure. It's like it's the people but at the same time, it's like, if the place doesn't feel like homey, despite the people that I'm with, it's like, yeah, yeah, because I don't really have a permanent home.

Like, if I were to have like a permanent residence here. Like, I know, for sure. It's like, I'm not paying rent. Like, I don't mind paying rent, but it's like, as long as like, I know for sure that we'll be living here. Like, I don't have like a year's lease. Like, once I feel like, like it's permanent permanent then yeah, that would that would like really help with like, feeling more at home, but I feel, I don't know. It's like, yeah, I've going around circles, but it does feel like, like at home, but not really like, there's no place that feels like at home. Even though regardless of like the people I'm with, even though they made me feel like at home. The place that I'm with them, like the place where I am with them, it's just doesn't feel like at home.”

## Stories of Migration

Placeholder text.

### "When I had to leave, I feel like I was doing a disservice to the nation."

**Claire Baguio**: So, again you talked again, about how you consider like, your friends places, like all these people, like where you feel safe and secure? How do you feel like you've made a home here, like in Canada? Or do you feel like...maybe this is a loaded question, but do you want to go back to the Philippines? 
 
**Jasper Mallonga**: Oh, yeah, it is a loaded question.  
 
**CB**: Yeah, you don't have to answer. I'm just curious, like the nature of this conversation, I’m just like, super curious.  
 
**JM**: Oh, it’s totally fine. But to your first question, I feel like I have made myself a home in Canada, but I wouldn't say so that I made it a home. I think a lot, a really big part of it was, you know, that I was with my parents and my siblings the entire time. And I feel like it would have been much more difficult to make a home, if it was, if it were just me. And that's me basing it off the experiences of the other people that I know who are here on their own, whether, you know, they're studying, or they moved alone, it's much, it must have been a lot more difficult. So, yeah, I mean, I’m just recognizing that it's an, it's been an easy process for me. 

And going home. That's, that's also something for me to think about, honestly, because sometimes, if I had the choice, if I wanted to go home right now, like to the Philippines, and, you know, stay there long term...I'll also feel like I wouldn't belong as much. Not not so much in terms of, you know, integration and whatnot. I can be, I can be there one day and not and pretend like, Canada never happened for me, I can, I can totally do that. But it's like, I guess this goes back to the safety and security aspects of how I define what a home is. Because when I go back there, you know, I might be with the friends that I have really known as family all these years, but then I wouldn't feel safe and secure in terms of like having a job, or being able to sustain myself while I'm there, is maybe the question. My dad is still there, and I have a few family friends who are there, maybe that will help me a little bit. But that's more on the belongingness side of things, and not really that safety and security side. 
 
**CB**: Like you can't, you don't feel like you'd be able to, like, build the life you want for years. 
 
**JM**: Or maybe it's just easier if I stayed here. Yeah, because, you know, I left the Philippines right after graduating, so I don't have work connections. I still have my, you know, make connections from UP well might be wherever industries, but it doesn't feel...I would feel like I'll be starting from scratch if I went back now. But long run. I mean, I think one of the reasons I didn't want to leave the Philippines in the first place is...there's...I know the stories of the people there. 

And this might be me leaning in more on my, on my advocacies. But before I left, I was working on this renewable energy project with a with people with a community from Aurora, which is like, very far, like an eight hour ride car ride from from Manila, and they're on the other side of the Sierra Madre mountain ranges. So, they're, they're not connected to the electric grid at all. And so, they have to rely on other sources of electricity. And, you know, it's it's that part that really, people, some people still have don't still don't have access to reliable energy. And there's not a lot of people working for for their sake. And also something that they instil in students in UP is that you know, “you're a scholar of the nation.” Iskolar ng bayan. And being of service is a really big part of who you are, at least for me. And when I had to leave, I feel like I was doing a disservice to the nation kind of, kind of thing.

**CB**: Wow, really? Because like you weren't able to continue that work while you were here.

**JM**: I wasn't. Studying in UP is…like, the government pays a lot of expenses for you, you don't really feel it, but like, it's, it's huge. And it's, it's partly that, but also like, knowing that there's people who need your help, and you're moving to a place to kind of, you know, sustain yourself. It feels like I'm betraying someone, or betraying the people and saying…

**CB**: Betraying the values that you learned at UP almost?

**JM**: Like literally the people who I’m leaving, you know? I mean, it's very easy to say quality of life here is very different from there. And it feels unfair that I'm getting to enjoy this kind of life when some, many people back home are not, you know, they don't even have electricity for God's sake. And yeah, it's...so long term, I still really want to be able to help as much as I can. And that maybe that's also one of the things that I carry while I'm here. It's like, how do I? How can I be of service? While I'm far away, still? Yeah, long term. That was the long plan.

### "When I was living with a lot of Filipinos, I felt like, I didn't have to question myself so much."

**Hannah Balba**: “I was born in the Philippines. I was born in Manila. And both my parents are also Filipino. But in 2001, they decided to move to Canada, specifically Richmond BC as we had some connections in the city. So yeah, I lived in Richmond, basically all my life. I moved there in 2001, we moved to a very working class neighborhood called Colonial Drive. And that's a part of I think, Seafair West Richmond area– That is, historically, there's a lot of working class, new immigrants that settle in that neighborhood, because it's a more affordable part of Richmond. 
So, yeah, growing up in Richmond was interesting, because I think, in the neighborhood that I lived in, there were actually a lot of Filipinos, because a lot of them are also newcomers, like our family. So I grew up with a lot of Filipinos in that sense, I think there was about maybe 9 or 10 Filipino families that I grew up with. And I'm still friends with a lot of them to this day. And so, I think, because we all grew up together, all of our parents kind of took care of each other, took care of us. I think being Filipino in Richmond, in that setting, I never really kind of felt isolated, just because I was around a lot of Filipinos all the time. 
But it wasn't until you know, because I think Colonial Drive is a very, it's a stepping stone for a lot of people, for a lot of newcomers. Because eventually, we all moved out of that neighborhood into different parts of Richmond. So I don't see those Filipino families as much, but we're still very much close. And we're still very much friends. But I think when I moved out of that neighborhood, that was kind of when I started to feel ... that's when I started to feel a little bit different.”

**Hannah Balba**:“...when I was living with a lot of Filipinos, I I felt like, I didn't have to question myself so much. I didn't have to question my worth, I didn't have to question my identity, because they just accepted me. Right? I didn't have to prove anything. But then when I moved, yeah, but then when I, you know, moved to what we wanted, we all moved away. And when I because I think when I when we moved away, it was like, a very critical time in my life, like I was a teenager, right? I went from, you know, growing up with my childhood friends, and like, staying, and living with them and seeing them every day, to going into high school, and then not having them anymore. Like, it was a very you know, and it was a very, it was very jarring experience, to say the least, because we were all we were you know, like we could see each other every day. And we were also able to kind of commiserate on like, on like, on, you know, like how we did at school and then like, and just like having that support like that consistency. I think that having it having that consistency, you know, and not having and then not having that consistency anymore. Just really I think was really affected me a lot.”

[44:35-52:02]

**Claire Baguio**: All right. So, Tita Darla, tell me a little bit more about what it was like, for your partner to leave for many, many years and not be able to live together and how that influenced your migration.

**Darla Tomeldan**: Okay. All right. So, um, yeah, so you can see the work that we do today in Vancouver is influenced by immigration experience, right? Or lived immigration experience. So again, a little bit of background. So, Cecilia, and I met at University of the Philippines suppose in around 1980. And then, became more than just friends, two years later, continue to, then I have to say, Cecilia hates it. We're now going 42 years.

**CB**: 42 years!

**DT**: Yeah, so, after university, we faced, you know, migration, migration policy hurdles. And we were forced into long distance relationship for many, many years. I ended up in the US and, as Cecilia had mentioned, she ended up in Canada. It was quite a distance. And so, it was kind of hard because you're kind of like maintaining two separate households, unlike when couples live together. It was kinda hard. And being women, you know, the wage gap and all that. That's also one impact, one hurdle that we had too. So, most of our- and mind you, there was no Skype at that time, no phone cards. So, our phone bills were humongous. Airline tickets, just to come visit each other. Right? On whatever salary we had. We were women, and again, a wage gap, right? You have to consider that. And airports were very lonely and sad places for us ‘cause one was staying, and one was leaving. Right? So, airports were very sad for us. And you know sometimes we’d say “oh one of these days, we're going to be at an airport and both be going somewhere together, you know?” Yeah, and didn't happen for so many years.

And in mind you, during that time, you know, they like…Cecilia had, you know, mentioned the struggles that she went through as a caregiver here. And it was hard because there were no cell phones at that time. She would go to a payphone outside in Canada in winter, you know, putting in quarters. Just being on the phone, right? It was hard. It was difficult, because I mean, how do I comfort her? I'm there, she's here. And she's dealing with all these issues here. And then, of course, I have many other issues that I had to deal with too, right, where I was at in San Francisco. But that went on for a while because, again, even when Cecilia got her permanent residence, she couldn't include me in her application. Because during that time, with the Immigration Refugee Protection Act, the definition of a spouse is someone you're married to and of the opposite sex. That was what the law was at that time. So, there was no way a person can sponsor or add into the application, a same sex sex partner. Now there was no same sex marriage at that time yet too. 

**CB**: That's true. 

**DT**: In Canada, they were still debating it left and right. And when they did come up with a same sex marriage, it was provincial, depends on which province you're at. So, it was only you know, in our lifetime a lot of changes happened. Same sex marriage became legal. But we were able to reunite in Canada and it was based on the humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Right? So, our application was very thick. And we had to prove to immigration that there was grounds for them, humanitarian compassionate grounds for them, to grant us permission to live together in Canada. As a gay couple. We were like the second couple, I think. We joined the Lesbian and Gay Immigration Task Force which was founded by Chris Morrissey, I’d like to mention that, and Bridget, may she rest in peace. They were both nuns. And they they were the founders of LEGIT, Lesbian and Gay Immigration Task Force. It was new at the time. So, we joined them and they, they taught us how to do our application, humanitarian and compassionate.

So, immigration was letting us in through the backdoor. Right? But humanitarian compassionate cases, they're not all successful. It was a very low success rate. Okay. And it's discretionary, depends on the immigration officer. Okay. Hopefully the immigration officer interviewing you got up on the right side of the bed, right? It's discretionary. So yeah, I was able to come in through the humanitarian, compassionate grounds. That was in 1994, so it took a long time, but we finally got together. But we wanted it legislated. So, we continued with LEGIT, to organize and to lobby the government. Though Chris Morrissey and Bridget, they didn't do humanitarian compassionate grounds, they went all the way to the Supreme Court.

**CB**: Really?

**DT and Cecilia Tumolva**: To change, to challenge the policy

**CT**: To challenge, change the law

**DT**:And then we continued lobbying the government saying that under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, we're not defined as a family, and therefore your policy is discriminatory. People have, you know, the right to challenge whatever policy they think is discriminatory. Okay. So that went on for almost a decade. And then finally, in June, I believe of 2002, they changed the definition of spouse. This is immigration. They changed the definition of spouse to someone you're married to or living common law of the opposite sex or same sex. So not only gay couples were included in the definition also heterosexual common law couples. So, it's good for everybody.

**CB**: It's great for everyone.

**DT**:
So yeah, we didn't only fight for LGBTQ rights, but for everybody with support, so...
